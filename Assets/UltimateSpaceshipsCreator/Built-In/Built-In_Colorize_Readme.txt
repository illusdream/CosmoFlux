This is the Colorize shaders and materials for use only with the Built-In Render Pipeline after "Shader Graph" package has been installed using the "Package Manager" from Unity's Registry.
(Window menu--> Package Manager --> Pick Shader Graph from Unity's Registry and Install)

If you are using Universal 3D or High Definition 3D you will get the Colorize shaders and materials once you import "URP_Upgrade" or "HDRP_Upgrade" from the "SRP" folder and you do not need this file.
