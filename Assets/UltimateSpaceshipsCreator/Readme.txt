Pink? If you import into your project and see materials in pink or if nothing is visible in scene, simply open up the SRP folder and import the "URP_Upgrade" package if you have a Universal 3D project or import the "HDRP_Upgrade" package if you have a High Definition 3D project.

If scene lighting appears to be dark, you can go to the Window menu, Rendering, Lighting. Then from the Scene tab click on Generate lighting.
--------------------------------------------------------

Custom create your colors in the editor and remove weathering or logos. 

If you are using Universal 3D or High Definition 3D render pipelines after importing the "URP_Upgrade" or "HDRP_Upgrade" from the "SRP" folder you will see a new "Colorize" folder containing the colorize shaders/materials which you can modify to create your own colors.

If you are using Built-In Render Pipeline, you will need to first install Unity's "Shader Graph" package from the Package Manager. You will find the Shader Graph Package inside "Pacakges: Unity Registry". After installing shader graph, you can import the "Built-In_Colorize" from the "Built-In" folder which will add a "Colorize" folder containing the colorize shaders/materials.

Additional 4K textures for the smaller spaceships and PSD files are available for free download from the "USC Bonus Files" pack located here: http://u3d.as/2Abs

When importing the bonus files pack, it's recommended that you start a new project, download and import the bonus files to it. Then manually replace the 2K textures you wish to change with the new 4K textures.
